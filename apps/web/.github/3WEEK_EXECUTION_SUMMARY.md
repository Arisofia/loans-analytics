## How to Execute

### Option 1: Full Team Execution (Recommended)

Assign week ownership:

- **Week 1**: DevOps/Infrastructure lead (2-4 hours with team support)
- **Week 2**: QA/DevOps/Dev leads (4-6 hours, all teams participate)
- **Week 3**: Tech lead (2-4 hours, all teams participate)

### Option 2: One Person Execution

Single person can execute all weeks sequentially (less ideal but possible).

### Option 3: Phased Rollout

Execute weeks as different teams become available.

---

## Step-by-Step Execution (Week 1 Example)

Here's exactly how to execute Week 1:
### 
```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to repo
cd /Users/jenineferderas/Documents/abaco-loans-analytics/apps/web

# Step 2: Verify prerequisites (10 min)
gh --version
gh auth status
git rev-parse --git-dir

# Step 3: Gather secrets (20 min)
# [Collect 7 secrets from Supabase, Azure, Sentry]

# Step 4: Run setup script (30 min)
chmod +x .github/setup-secrets.sh
.github/setup-secrets.sh
# [Follow prompts, enter each of 7 secrets]

# Step 5: Verify secrets were created (10 min)
gh secret list -R owner/repo
# Should show 7 secrets

# Step 6: Check configuration files (5 min)
ls -la config/environments/
# Should show staging.yml, production.yml
```
### 
```bash
# Step 1: Create GitHub environments
# [Go to GitHub web UI → Settings → Environments]
# [Create: staging, production (v* rule), production-rollback]

# Step 2: Team onboarding
# [Share README.md with everyone]
# [Share QUICK_START.md with developers]
# [Share TEAM_RUNBOOKS.md with QA and DevOps]
# [Share DEPLOYMENT_COORDINATION.md with all]

# Step 3: Final verification
git status
ls -la .github/workflows/*.yml
# Verify all 5 workflows exist
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Week 1 Issues
### 
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow prompts to authenticate
```
### 
```bash
# Wait 30 seconds, then check again
gh secret list -R owner/repo

# If still not visible, manually create one
gh secret set STAGING_SUPABASE_URL -b "value" -R owner/repo
```
### 
- Verify you have admin access to repository
- Check: Settings → Environments → New environment
### 
```bash
mkdir -p config/environments
# Then create files manually with content from SETUP_GUIDE.md
```

### Week 2 Issues
### 
- Check: Repository → Actions → Workflows → ci.yml
- Verify: Workflow is on main/develop branch
- Check: Workflow has correct triggers (on: push, pull_request)
### 
- Verify: Merged to develop branch (not main)
- Check: Workflow file: deploy-staging.yml
- Wait: 1-2 minutes for GitHub to detect merge
### 
- Verify: GitHub environment "production" exists
- Check: Environment has approval requirement (Settings → Environments → production)
- Create: v*.*.* tag (must use semantic versioning)

### Week 3 Issues
### 
- Share: QUICK_START.md for daily workflow
- Share: TEAM_RUNBOOKS.md for their role
- Schedule: 30-minute Q&A session in #dev-help
### 
- Go to: Slack workspace → Create new channel
- Create: #dev-alerts, #prod-alerts, #incidents, #dev-help
